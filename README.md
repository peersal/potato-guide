# Prolific Annotation Task Setup

## Overview

This branch documents the progress of setting up annotation tasks using a server and integrating it with Prolific. The goal is to create a reproducible process that can be customized for future projects.

## Objectives

1. **Setup Prolific Annotation Tasks**: Document the step-by-step process of setting up annotation tasks on a server and integrating them with Prolific.
2. **Setum Google VM**: Learn and implement methods to rent a VM and what necessary features we need.
3. **Settup Domain and HTTPS**: Seamlessly integrate the annotation server with Prolific for smooth task management and participant interaction.
4. **Remote Machine Execution**: Ensure that the entire setup can run efficiently on a remote machine.
6. **Reproducible Process**: Develop a custom, reproducible process that can be used for future projects.




# Basic Potato Annotation Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Potato for annotations via Prolific.

## 1. Install Potato

If not done create a virtual python ennvironment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv <your_env_name>
<your_env_name>\Scripts\activate
```

To install Potato, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install potato-annotation
```

## 2. Choose Project Schema or Examples

You can select a project schema or modify an example to fit your needs:

- [Example Projects](https://potato-annotation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example-projects/)
- [Schemas and Templates](https://potato-annotation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schemas_and_templates/)

```bash
potato get project_name
```

## 3. Create Custom Project Folder

To create a custom project folder, execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir project_name
cd project_name
mkdir data annotation_output configs surveyflow
```

The project folder is organized into the following directories:

1. **`data`**:
   - Contains all the raw data required for the task. The data should be in the format specified by the configuration files (e.g., CSV, JSON). This directory holds the input data for processing and annotation.

2. **`annotation_output`**:
   - Stores all annotated outputs generated by users. After performing annotations, the results are saved in this folder. This helps track user-specific annotations, which can later be used for analysis or further processing.

3. **`configs`**:
   - Contains the configuration files for the project, including the main `.yaml` file and any additional configuration files needed for the setup (e.g., Prolific survey settings, task specifications).

4. **`surveyflow`**:
   - Holds the survey flow, which includes all the pre- and post-annotation questions in a `.json` format. For example, this may include introductory text, consent agreements, or other important instructions for users participating in the task.

## 4. Create a Basic Config File

Create a `config.yaml` file in the `configs` directory with the following content:

```yaml
# Name of the annotation task
annotation_task_name: "Example Name"

# Directory where Potato will write the annotation files
output_annotation_dir: "annotation_output/simple-multirate/"

# Format of the output annotation files. Allowed formats are:
# * jsonl
# * json (same output as jsonl)
# * csv
# * tsv
output_annotation_format: "csv"

# URL of the annotation codebook (if any)
annotation_codebook_url: ""

# List of data files to be used for the annotation task
data_files:
  - "data/toy-example.json"  # Input data, see allowed types here: https://potato-annotation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_format/

# Properties of the items in the data files
item_properties:
  id_key: "id"
  text_key: "text"

# User configuration, see here: https://potato-annotation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_and_collaboration/
user_config:
  allow_all_users: True
  users: []

# Alert time configuration for each instance
alert_time_each_instance: 10000000

# Choose scheme from here: https://potato-annotation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schemas_and_templates/ e.g., "multirate"
# Here you will define the Survey layout
annotation_schemes:
  - annotation_type: "multirate"
    name: "awesomeness"  # This name gets used in reporting the annotation results
    description: "Rate this Speech"  # This text is shown to the user and can be a longer statement
    display_config:
      num_columns: 1
    arrangement: "vertical"
    options: ["Evidence Based", "Intuition based"]
    labels: ["Strongly disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree"]
    label_requirement:
      required: True  # Adding requirements for labels, when "required" is True, the annotators will be asked to finish the current instance to proceed
    sequential_key_binding: True  # If true, keys [1-size] will be bound to scale responses. Likert scales larger than 10 are not supported with this simple keybinding and will need to use the full item specification to bind all scale points to keys.
    option_randomization: True  # Whether randomizing the order of the options

# HTML layout configuration
html_layout: "default"

# Base HTML template configuration
base_html_template: "default"
header_file: "default"

# Directory where the actual HTML files will be generated
site_dir: "default"
```

## 5. Add Survey Flow

Add the following survey flow configuration to the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
surveyflow:
  on: true
  order:
    - "pre_annotation"
    - "post_annotation"
  pre_annotation:
    - "surveyflow/consent.jsonl"
  post_annotation: []
  testing: []
```

## 6. Add Task Assignment

Add the following task assignment configuration to the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
automatic_assignment:
  on: True
  output_filename: 'task_assignment.json'
  sampling_strategy: 'random'
  labels_per_instance: 3
  instance_per_annotator: 5
  test_question_per_annotator: 0
```

## 7. Integrate Potato with Prolific

Add the following Prolific integration to the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
prolific:
  config_file_path: 'configs/prolific_config.yaml'

# Login configuration
login:
  type: 'prolific'

# UI configuration
jumping_to_id_disabled: False
hide_navbar: True
```

## 8. Create Prolific Config File

Create a `prolific_config.yaml` file in the `configs` directory with the following content:

```yaml
# Prolific API token
token: 'your prolific token'
# Prolific study ID
study_id: 'your study id'
# Maximum number of concurrent sessions
max_concurrent_sessions: 3
# Workload checker period in seconds
workload_checker_period: 60
```

## 9. Create Server Directory and Open Port

Set up the server directory and open the required port.

## 10. Run Project

Run the project with the following command (select the main config file when asked):

```bash
potato run project_name -p8000
```

## 11. Update Server Address on Prolific

Update the server address on Prolific as described in the [Potato Crowdsourcing Guide](https://potato-annotation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crowdsourcing/).
